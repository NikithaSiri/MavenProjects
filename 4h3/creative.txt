Hi everyone or should i say "Annyeonghaseyo"(wink)
Anyways, I am more of a
Netflix
person who regret watching the series whole night and yet won't stop doing it.
i watch movies like 
Ittefaq.
Korean dramas and movies have been thing for  quite some time now
and shortly
"I am a nightmare dressed like a day dream":p just kidding I love 
Taylor Swift, She has always been my inspiration.
At present i am binging 
"HIMYM" 
I am as punctual and sincere as
"Amy" from brooklyn Nine-nine.
