1.Java OOP

What is OOP?
Any Programming Language is prefered

 Ability of the programmer to programme what he/she sees and hears....

Abilty to create of something existing  by identifyying its state and behaviors

All OOP Languaged foiolow bottom-up-Aproach

Customer:----> Create and application/software to Store the information of  Employees
EMS---->EIS

Programmer
Employees in real world
Employee states and behaviour

Employee is and Object
Employee has states and behaviour


// Syntax Building for the Application

In Java How to Build the Objects ie(Blue Print of the Object)

We use a class has key word to create classes

class Employee
{
int eid
String name,email,phone,

int salary ;
void viewsalry()
{
}
applyleave()
{
}
workAssigned()
{

}
}


// Then creating of object to make the states and beahviours working for it

in Java we create an object of a class by using new keyword

Employee obj=new Employee();
	obj.eid=100;
	obj.name="aaa";
	obj.salary=1000;





Why OOPS became Popular?
Bcoz of ceartain Features of OOP
1.Encapsulation: Hiiding the complex /essential details of the code
2.Abstraction: Expose essentials details of the code
3.Inheritance: Reusablity,Generalization& Specialization,Identifying the relationships between the Objects
4.Polymorphism: Makeing ur object to perform diiferent operation for different cases




Employee

Differnt Types of Employee

Organiztion has 2 Types of  Employees
 
a.PermanentEmployee : some thig which is not common to other type of employee (proabarion period 3 months)

Employee

PermEmp is a type of Employee

ContractEmp is a Type of Employee


Soln
PermEmp is-A  Emploee

ContractEmp is-A Type of Employee
in java to associate is-a relationship how to syntactically achieve


use extends keye

Comapny  has-A (Employee,perm,contract)--->Aggreation( ie it is another form of inheriantce)



Polymorphism

Employee has work,Every Employee has work



Abstract Class: and imaginary class

abstract class Animal: abstract
