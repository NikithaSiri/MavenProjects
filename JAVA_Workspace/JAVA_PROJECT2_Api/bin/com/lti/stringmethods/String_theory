Mutable Strings
One of its biggest strength Immutability is also biggest problem of Java String if not used correctly. 
many a times we create a String and then perform a lot of operation on them e.g. converting string into uppercase, lowercase , getting substring out of it , concatenating with other string etc. 
Since String is an immutable class every time a new String is created and older one is discarded which creates lots of temporary garbage in heap. If String are created using String literal they remain in String pool. 
To resolve this problem Java provides us two Classes StringBuffer and StringBuilder.
