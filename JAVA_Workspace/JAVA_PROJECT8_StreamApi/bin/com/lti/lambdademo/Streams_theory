Streams very well / designed to wrok with streams
------------------------
Streams:
input, output streams
System.out.println

New Stream API
why?

collections-ArrayList Maps- Huge huge objects
performing collective operations of collection framework - not easy-lot of code
1. who's employee with maximum salary ?
2. What's total salary of all employeees?
3. Min age of employee - city -mumbai 

--solution - New Stream Api 
1. it can be parellely processed    - 
    muliple Cpus  multicore cpus - more than processor 
make use both  processors parelkley to find total sal - yes - fork join 
2. faster than old collection framework methods bec it works with lambda
